summary: Vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data.
description: |
  The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive,
  process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and
  maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats
  (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

        A global opentelemetry-collector "processors" config in YAML format, without the

        such as:

            processors:
              batch:
              memory_limiter:
                limit_mib: 4000

        you could use `juju config otelcol processors=@processors.yaml`, with:

            # processors.yaml
            batch:
            memory_limiter:
              limit_mib: 4000

        The provided processors section will be applied to all relevant pipelines.
