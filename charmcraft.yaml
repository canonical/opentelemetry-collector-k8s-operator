summary: Vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data.
description: |
  The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive,
  process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and
  maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats
  (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

      For otelcol to create a trusted (TLS) connection with servers
      it scrapes, pushes to, etc., it needs to trust the CA that signed
      the server it talks to. CA certs forwarded over this relation are
      installed in the root CA store.

      The charm sends a CSR over this relation and receives a signed certificate back.
      That is the cert that would be presented to incoming TLS connections.

  options:
    processors:
      type: string
      description: |
        A global opentelemetry-collector "processors" config in YAML format, without the
        "processors:" top-level key. For example, to represent a "processors" section
        such as:
        
            processors:
              batch:
              memory_limiter:
                limit_mib: 4000

        you could use `juju config otelcol processors=@processors.yaml`, with:

            # processors.yaml
            batch:
            memory_limiter:
              limit_mib: 4000

        The provided processors section will be applied to all relevant pipelines.

        If "true", self-signed certs can be used seamlessly; this setting will be applied

        requests to servers, e.g. the prometheus receiver scraping metrics endpoints.
