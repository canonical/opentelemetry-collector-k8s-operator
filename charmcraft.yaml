summary: Vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data.
description: |
  The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, 
  process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and 
  maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats 
  (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.
