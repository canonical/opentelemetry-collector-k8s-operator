"""Feature: Relation-dependant Opentelemetry-collector config.

Scenario: Relate to a data sink
    Given   A valid config requires at least one pipeline and it must have a at least one
            receiver-exporter pair
    And     An OTLP receiver is added to all signal (logs, metrics, traces) pipelines
    When    A data-sink charm is integrated with the otelcol charm
    Then    A relevant exporter is added to the config

Scenario: Relate to a data source
    Given   A valid config requires at least one pipeline and it must have a at least one
            receiver-exporter pair
    When    A data-source charm is integrated with the otelcol charm
    Then    A relevant receiver is added to the config
    And     If there is no exporter for that pipeline
    Then    A debug exporter is added for that receiver-exporter pair to ensure a valid config
